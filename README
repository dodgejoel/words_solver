This is a script which calculates all of the legal plays on a given Words with
Friends board and prints out a list of them sorted by score.  All you have to
do is enter the current board state and the tiles in your hand into the file
board_state.py and then run words_main_script.py. 

Note: Currently no implementation of blank tiles.  This is the next thing I
would like to add.
