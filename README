This is a script which calculates all of the legal plays on a given Words with
Friends board and prints out a list of them sorted by score.  All you have to
do is enter the current board state and the tiles in your hand into the file
board_state.py and then run words_main_script.py. 

Notes: Currently, only finds horizontally played words but this will surely be
fixed before anyone even sees this note as it is a really trivial extension of
what is already here to make it find all vertical plays as well.
